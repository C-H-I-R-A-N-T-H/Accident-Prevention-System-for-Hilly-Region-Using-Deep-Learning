# 🚨 AI-Based Vehicle, Animal & Accident Detection System (YOLOv8 + Arduino)

This project is an advanced **real-time road safety and accident detection system** that integrates **YOLOv8 object detection**, **Arduino-based alert hardware**, **automatic email alerts with snapshots**, and **location tracking**. The system detects vehicles and animals, sends alerts to Arduino for LED/LCD notifications, and automatically emails a snapshot with GPS location if an accident is detected.

 **Key Features**

**1. YOLOv8 Real-Time Object Detection**

* Detects:

  * Cars
  * Trucks
  * Motorcycles
  * Buses
  * Animals (dog, cow, elephant, deer, etc.)
* Filters only relevant classes for high performance.

**2. Arduino Alert Communication**

The system sends serial codes to Arduino:

| Object     | Signal |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Motorcycle | `1`    |
| Car        | `2`    |
| Truck/Bus  | `3`    |
| Animal     | `4`    |

 **3. Accident Detection Using Bounding Box Overlap**

* Continuously checks if two detected objects are overlapping.
* If overlap persists for **more than 3 seconds**, it's classified as an accident.
* A snapshot is captured and emailed instantly.

 **4. Automatic Email Alert**

When an accident is detected:

* Captures a frame
* Gets GPS-like coordinates using IP-based geolocation
* Sends email with:

  * Accident message
  * Google Maps link
  * Snapshot attached

 **5. Location Tracking**

Uses `ipinfo.io` to fetch approximate coordinates and generates a clickable Google Maps link.

 **Dependencies**

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python pyserial requests
```

YOLO model file:

* `yolov8s.pt` (automatically downloaded by Ultralytics library)

---

 **Hardware Used**

* Arduino UNO/Nano
* LCD 16x2 (I2C)
* OLED 128x64 (SSD1306)
* LEDs (Red, Green, Animal alert)
* Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
* External USB Webcam

---

 **Arduino Serial Mapping**

Python sends:

* `'1'` → Motorcycle Ahead
* `'2'` → Car Ahead
* `'3'` → Bus/Truck Ahead
* `'4'` → Animal Ahead
* `'0'` → No detection (Safe)

Arduino then updates:

* LCD Display
* LEDs (Red, Green, Animal)
* OLED for distance monitoring

 **How It Works**

 **Main Loop**

1. Capture video from external webcam.
2. Run YOLOv8 detection.
3. Identify vehicle/animal type.
4. Send signal to Arduino.
5. Check bounding box overlap.
6. If overlap > 3 sec → trigger accident.
7. Save snapshot.
8. Send email alert.

 **Snapshot Saving**

Images are saved inside:

```
accident_snapshots/snapshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg
```

---

 **Email Alert Format**

Subject: **"🚨 Accident Detected"**

Body includes:

```
Accident detected!
📍 Location: https://www.google.com/maps?q=<lat,long>
Snapshot attached.
```

---

 **API Used**

`ipinfo.io` → Get approximate location based on public IP.

---

 **Run the System**

Run Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Ensure Arduino is connected to the correct COM port.

---

 **Testing**

* Show two vehicles overlapping to simulate a collision.
* Verify:

  * LCD alert updates
  * LEDs change state
  * OLED displays distance
  * Email with location + snapshot arrives
